		<h1>Rj Bernaldo</h1>
		<h2>Personal History</h2>
		<p>Born and raised in the Philippines. Graduated from Multimedia Arts. I can safely say that I picked the wrong course - LOL. Currently working at a tech startup named Aarki. Moved departments 3 times - what!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Multimedia Specialist</h3><br><i>My first position.</i> Found myself wanting to help out in building our product rather than using it to make projects.</li>
			<li><h3>Ad Ops</h3><br><b>Second!</b> Wanted something technical, but did not know where to start. I mostly used my off-time at this position to teach myself programming. This stage is where I found DBC.</li>
			<li><h3>Front End Engineer</h3><br>Finally! After lots of studying on my own, our CEO finally agreed to transfer me into the software engineer team! Right now, I handle mostly Javascript stuff. My position is somewhat of a hybrid role since I am not that good yet - part JS developer, part product manager. It is confusing and very frustrating at times, especially since I only want to focus on the building part!</li>

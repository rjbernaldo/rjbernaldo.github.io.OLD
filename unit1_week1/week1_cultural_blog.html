		<h2>Adventure</h2>
		<p>This value is important to me because in reality, life is one big adventure. People should not be content with where they currently are, or the learning will stop. I was so confused with school because I did not practice this value at that time. I would often times get bored, or do meaningless things. Once I finished school, and began to get involved in work and technology, that is where I found the true meaning of adventure.</p>

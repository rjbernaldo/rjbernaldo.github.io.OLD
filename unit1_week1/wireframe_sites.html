		<h1>Soundcloud.com</h1>
		<p>This website is trying to bridge the gap between music artists & listeners. I love this website! It is simple enough to understand on the first usage, and complex enough for advanced users looking for more features or information.</p>

		<h1>Youtube.com</h1>
		<p>This website is severely changing the game in terms of media consumption. It presents the data (or video) to users in a simple manner, and at the same time, inform the user of related data using the sidebar.</p>

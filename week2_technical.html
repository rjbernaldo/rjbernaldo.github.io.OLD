			Week2 Technical - What are the differences between Relative, Absolute, & Fixed Positioning?
		</header>
		<div id="content">
			I picked this topic because this is was once confusing for me. I hope to get better at CSS styling by tackling all the topics I am unfamiliar of.

			Relative:
			Think of it this way: this element is static, and then you move it relative to this static position. For example: left: 10px will move the element 10px relative to the position it was originally in.
			Another factor that this style introduces is z-index. You will be able to set and adjust what appears on top of what element.
			Take note though that absolute positioned elements inside a relative positioned container, will only be able to move according to the container it is currently in.
			Absolute:
			Absolute is the most powerful positioning style available. It will position any element relative to it's container (or the body). This removes any flow from the element though, so be careful when using this.
			Fixed:
			Fixed means it is positioned relative to the current viewport or browser window itself.

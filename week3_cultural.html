			<h2>Pairing</h2>
			<p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challanges?</p>
			<p>It is incredible! One thing that I really like when pairing with others to solve challenges is the fact that apart from making a friend, it actually speeds up the thought process and/or reinforce your previous knowledge. On some parts where I was more experienced, I would share my knowledge and be able to understand it better as I explained it. On the other hand, if there was something I have no experience with but my pair does, I will be able to learn with a different style than just searching for it on google.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Feedback</h2>
			<p>I felt excited as I was opening it. As I was reading it, it made me feel like there is still so much to do. I mean, although some of the exercises I went through were pretty simple, pair programming is not only about the task at hand. It is also about proper communication with your partner. All in all, for me, pair programming brings in a pretty interesting factor to the whole DBC experience, and feedback will undoubtedly make me better at it.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>I have always thought about building stuff alone when I was teaching myself how to program. But meeting all these people who are as eager as me to learn is an incredible experience!</p>

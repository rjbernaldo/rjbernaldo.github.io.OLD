<li><h3>Experience</h3>

<p>One experience where I felt Stereotyping was on my previous work. I used to work for a company that outsourced some of it&#39;s back-end functions to my country. It was weird because I mean, it was my first job, but this was the only time that I felt that I lived in a 3rd world country. The company as a whole wasn&#39;t really the problem, it was my department&#39;s boss.</p>

<p>I always felt that he thought that he was superior to me - through his actions &amp; through his words.</p></li>
<li><h3>How it affected me</h3>

<p>It was so weird for me because this is the first time in my life that I experienced this. It isn&#39;t my boss&#39; sole fault though. People in the office were acting like they were under my boss, it was like, they were happy to please him. It felt so weird, I did not understand why this was happening.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered everyone to be equal, and yet here I am, my boss looking down on me, and everyone of my colleagues looking up to him.</p></li>
<li><h3>What I did and what I plan to do</h3>

<p>One positive thing that came out from this was, since they really weren&#39;t expecting that much from me, it wasn&#39;t hard for me to prove them wrong. I put in all my effort into showing them that I am as capable as anyone in the main office. I had a personal talk with our CEO and he admired how driven I am to achieving my goals. He even granted me to transfer to the engineering department - even if I will be the only junior engineer in the local office. It was weird because I felt like I was coming in to work to telecommute as all my colleagues were located far away.</p>

<p>All in all, what I learned about the experience was, the only thing that is stopping you from achieving greatness is yourself. There will always be people who will look down on you. Instead of freaking out and being sad, rise up to the challenge and prove them wrong!</p></li>

			Why is Javascript so popular in Web Development?

			<h1>Mobility & Client-Side Development</h1>
			<p>Apple has recently changed the game with excellent User Experience. Browsing a website is no longer -ONLY- about data (Although I would say that is still the most important part of the web). A website's feedback now has a big effect on how successful your website will be. Javascript is flexible enough to be created with strict time restrictions because of it's simple learning curve, and at the same time be able to alter & improve traditional user experience. The advent of Javascript & other web programming languages have opened up the doors to web applications. You no longer need to download, install, & run a piece of software. Some developers create their apps thinking that users will interact with it only through a browser window.</p><br>
			<h1>Cloud & Server-Side Development</h1>
			<p>Javascript was previously only able to be used on front-end stuff, but with the birth of Node.js, it can now be used as with server-side tasks as well.</p>
